**Abstract**
The objective of Cohort 25’s (also referred to as “project team”) capstone project is to evaluate the relationship between attributes for a given professional team’s performance and outcome (e.g., team wins).  We hypothesize that given an appropriate volume of instances (e.g., game results) and data element features (e.g., home runs, game attendance) we can accurately predict a Major League Baseball professional team’s win total.
